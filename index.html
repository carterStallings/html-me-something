        <main><h3>How this club and sport became my passion</h3>
            <p>The summer after my sophomore year in college at the University of Arkansas, I was working a summer job on campus and one of my co-workers introduced me to the sport of soccer. More specifically he introduced me to Chelsea Football Club. I became very interested after seeing his passion for the game, so I decided to research and watch a few matches myself. What followed, I did not expect. After just watching a few matches, I was hooked. And this would be an obession that would not fade.

            <h3>Why I love Chelsea FC</h3>
            <p>I have found that supporting Chelsea Football club has been a huge blessing from God in my life. It has proven to be a perfect escape from this sometimes scary world. I cherish my early Saturday mornings when I wake up and tune into matches taking place on a whole other continent. This time allows me to forget about all the stresses of life. It truly is amazing how when you give a club a piece of your heart, watching them play every weekend, can remove burdens, even if it is just for a couple of hours.

            <h3>Chelsea's Success</h3>
            <p>Supporting a Premier League club is an absolute blast in and of itself. But it is even more exciting when your club is very competitive and has a rich history. Chelsea is a very exciting club and they always make a run at the Premier League title each year. Not to mention, it is eye opening to see the big business that takes place in clubs like Chelsea. For example, our current most expensive player cost the club &#163;71,500,000.
