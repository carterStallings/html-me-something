        <main><h3>How this club and sport became my passion</h3>
            <p>The summer after my sophomore year in college at the University of Arkansas, I was working a summer job on campus and one of my co-workers introduced me to the sport of soccer. More specifically he introduced me to Chelsea Football Club. After just watching a few matches, I was hooked.

            <h3>Why I love Chelsea FC</h3>
            <p>I have found that supporting Chelsea Football club has allowed been a huge blessing from God in my life. He has blessed me with this passion and it has proven to be a perfect escape from this very dark world. I cherish my early Saturday mornings when I wake and tune to matches taking place in England in week, and can for just a bit, forget about all the stresses of life.

            <h3>Chelsea's Success</h3>
            <p>Supporting a Premier League club is an absolute blast in and of itself. But it is even more exciting when your club is very competitive and has a rich history. Chelsea is a very exciting club and they always make a run at the Premier League title each year. Not to mention, it is eye opening to see the big business that takes place in clubs like Chelsea. For example, our current most expensive player costed the club &#163;71,500,000.
